# One-Dimensional Model for TRMLs
This repository contains annotated notebooks that can be used to compute one-dimensional solutions of Turbulent Radiative Mixng Layers.
Notebooks 1 & 2 allow users to specific their choices of vrel, h, f_nu, Prandtl, and t_cool_min and compute a corresponding solution using either the cosine vx or the cosine x-momentum profile setup, respectively. 
Notebooks 3 & 4 allow users to specific their choices of vrel, h, f_nu, and t_cool_min and determine the corresponding Prandtl choice that satisfies energy conservation (H_visc=0.5\*mdot\*vrel\*\*2). (again, using either the cosine vx or the cosine x-momentum profile setup, respectively)
